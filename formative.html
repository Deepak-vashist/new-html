           I have been creating <i>challenges</i> since <strong>November 22, 2019</strong>. Since then I have created four challenges such as<br>
           30 Days Of HTML</i>L,<i>30 Days Of JavaScript, 30 Days Of Python and 30 Days Of React</i> . The<mark> 30 Days Of <br>
           JavaScript </mark>is the most popular among the four challenges. While I was preparing this challenges, I was<br>
           taking lots of caffeine( C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) but I didn't take any <del>beer</del>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) instead I was<br>
           taking more <ins>juice</ins> . Do you think the comparison is correct, 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024? If you are answer is yes, then you <br> know <ins>exponential</ins>.</pre>

          Lines of a poem are short<br>
          It could be two or eight    <br>
          Not too short and not too long<br>
          Lines of compact meaning<br>
          Goes from left to right <br>
          That rhymes at each end  <br>
          The space should be reserved <br>
